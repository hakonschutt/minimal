Experimental approach minimal composer WordPress development environment

Requirements:
* PHP and a MySql-database
* PHP Composer

Step-by-step:
* Create an application folder and step into it: `mkdir minimal && cd minimal`
* Initialize a composer project: `composer init`
* Add the extra/wordpress-install-dir in `composer.json` Example in this repo.
```
"extra": {
    "wordpress-install-dir": "public/wp",
    "installer-paths": {
        "public/wp-content/themes/{$name}/": [
            "type:wordpress-theme"
        ],
        "public/wp-content/plugins/{$name}/": [
            "type:wordpress-plugin"
        ]
    }
}
```

```
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "composer",
        "url": "https://wpackagist.org"
    }
]
```

* Install a theme `composer require wpackagist-theme/twentyseventeen` or use this repos minimal theme "Almost Nothing".
* Add required `public/index.php` and `public/wp-config.php` and modify your settings to reflect web server and database.
